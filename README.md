1. Implement Stack using Arrays and using Linked lists [Push, Pop, Display].
2. Implement Queues using Arrays and using Linked Lists [Enqueue and Dequeue].
3. Write a program to implement Tower of Hanoi without recursion. Also Debug the code
   using gdb debugger. Share the screenshots of the gdb execution part in your assignment.
4. Write a program that convert the infix Expression in to Postfix Expression and then
   evaluate the postfix expression using stacks. [Note: There should be atleast one two digit
   operand in the expression]
5. Implement Stacks using Queues and Vice-versa.

1. Convert an unsorted Array into Sorted Array. Find the Starting and Ending position of
   a given Value in that sorted Array. {You should Pass the array to the functions }
   [Input:
   Array: 25,10,6,30,5,10,95,48,10,13
   Value: 10
   Output:
   Starting Occurrence : 3
   Ending Occurrence : 5 ]
2. Write a C program to ADD, DELETE, DISPLAY and SEARCH elements in a Singly Linked
   List .
3. Add the new Function to Reverse the elements in a linked list that you implemented
   in Question 2.
4. Implement Josephus problem using Linked List
