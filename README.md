1. Implement Stack using Arrays and using Linked lists [Push, Pop, Display].
2. Implement Queues using Arrays and using Linked Lists [Enqueue and Dequeue].
3. Write a program to implement Tower of Hanoi without recursion. Also Debug the code
   using gdb debugger. Share the screenshots of the gdb execution part in your assignment.
4. Write a program that convert the infix Expression in to Postfix Expression and then
   evaluate the postfix expression using stacks. [Note: There should be atleast one two digit
   operand in the expression]
5. Implement Stacks using Queues and Vice-versa.

1. Convert an unsorted Array into Sorted Array. Find the Starting and Ending position of
   a given Value in that sorted Array. {You should Pass the array to the functions }
   [Input:
   Array: 25,10,6,30,5,10,95,48,10,13
   Value: 10
   Output:
   Starting Occurrence : 3
   Ending Occurrence : 5 ]
2. Write a C program to ADD, DELETE, DISPLAY and SEARCH elements in a Singly Linked
   List .
3. Add the new Function to Reverse the elements in a linked list that you implemented
   in Question 2.
4. Implement Josephus problem using Linked List

1. C Program for Selection sort. 
2. C Program to find the given number is Circular Prime or not. 
3. Pre Order traversal on the tree built from given In Order and Post Order expressions. 
4. Given a Arithmetic Expression, build the expression tree and from the generated tree Evaluate the expression tree using its prefix notation.

1. Given a binary search tree, find height of it using C Program. 
2. Given some node values, build the binary search tree, and print the Pre, In and Post order traversal of the built BST. Condition is that 
   the Post order Traversal method should implement in Iterative Way. 
3. Using the implemented stack write program to convert an infix expression to postfix expression.

1. You should implement Adjacency List data structure to represent an undirected graph.
   The implemented adjacency list should be used to compute the number of connected components.
   The input graph file name will be provided as a command line argument.
2. Implement Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest path between Nodes.
   Output should print the adjacency matrix with the shortest paths.
